# Plugin installation

## 1. Install or update using composer

`composer require trustmate/magento-extension`

`composer update trustmate/magento-extension`

## 2. From command line run
  * php bin/magento module:enable TrustMate_Opinions
  * php bin/magento setup:upgrade
  * php bin/magento setup:di:compile
  * php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy pl_PL en_US (languages of your choice)

# Upgrading

## To version 3.0.0 from version 1.2.0+

BEFORE UPDATE:

Due to changed review storage structure, reviews from TrustMate need to be re-downloaded. Remove everything from `trustmate_product_opinions` table along with references:

```
DELETE FROM review WHERE trustmate_review_id IN (SELECT id FROM trustmate_product_opinions);
DELETE FROM trustmate_product_opinions;
```

If you're using older version, please remove all TrustMate reviews using review title for example.

AFTER UPDATE:

No action is required, reviews will download periodically (1000 in single job run). If you want to speed up this process - temporarly change cron job in module to be run more often, avoiding overlapping or download reviews manually using:


```
php bin/magento trustmate:import:opinions

```

## To version 2.1.0

* Due to bug in some older versions, if your products are identified in TrustMate using database identifier instead of SKU - please use new configuration option to keep this behaviour. Without it you may notice that new orders create brand new products on TrustMate side ignoring all existing ones.

## To version 1.2.0

* If you were using agreements from module please turn it off after upgrade. Use own agreement if necessary.
